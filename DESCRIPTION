Description: Utilities to retrieve and tidy U.S. macroeconomic time series
    from public government data providers. Functions streamline access to series
    from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED website, the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics flat files, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis full NIPA tables,
    then return consistent, tidy data frames ready for modeling and graphics.
    The package includes helpers for date alignment, log-linear projections,
    and common macro diagnostics, along with convenience plot builders for
    quick publication-quality charts.
