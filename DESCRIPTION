Description: Utilities to retrieve and tidy U.S. macroeconomic data series
    from public government data providers. Functions streamline access to series
    from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED),
    the Bureau of Labor Statistics flat files, and the Bureau of Economic
    Analysis National Income and Product Accounts tables, then return
    consistent, tidy data frames ready for modeling and graphics. The package includes
    helpers for date alignment, log-linear projections, and common macro diagnostics,
    along with convenience plot builders for quick publication-quality charts.
